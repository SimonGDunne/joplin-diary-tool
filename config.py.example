# Diary Folder ID (the tool will help you find this if needed)

# Default location (your primary/home location - used when automatic detection fails)
# This should be your most common location (home/work)

# Location detection method priority:
# 1. GPS CoreLocation (most accurate, requires permission)
# 2. DEFAULT_LOCATION as fallback (reliable for home/work)
# 3. Manual override with --location flag (always takes priority)
